<h3 class="quintessential-regular">Barnum Brown
<p></p>
Barnum Brown is an old collague of Professor Thistlewick's they've worked on many projects before.
<p></p>
"I came by the manor to talk to Thistlewick, I knew he would be here cause he's always here, the man never leaves his house so I felt no need
 to call ahead. That's why I didn't realise he had people over, I would never have come if I knew he already had guests.
 My sudden appearance made things rather akward as he introduced me to the ladies.

He told me to wait for him in the study, and left, I didn't see him again til his body was found.

I can't belive anyone would burn a flower of all things! Especially one as unique and groundbreaking as Midnight! Tons of research, 
<em>my</em> research, went into that bloom; and now its all for nothing! What sort of monster burns such a valuble and defenseless flower?"
