<h3>You confront the three suspects
    Magenta confesses to burning the flower


"Ms. Magenta, I suspect that YOU burned the orchid."

Magenta huffs, scowling. "Fine, yes I burned that dumb flower. That man cared about that flower more than any of his family, and he put ideas in Ivy's head.
But I didn't kill Thistlewick."


"So you admit to burning the flower but deny killing Thistlewick?"
 
"Yes, I resent his ridiculous side hobby but I never wanted him dead."

Ivy
"But, then who killed Thistlewick?"

You can answer this one, and tell the gathered as much.
"Thistlewick was killed by Barnum Brown."
    
Barnum glares but does not deny it.
"Yes, I killed Thistlewick. For years he has stolen my research and 
He even used my studies to create The Midnight Bloom, and of course, did not give me any credit for it's creation or a hand in who he sold it to.
My plan was to kill him and take Midnight for myself."
